[Observations]
- simplified chars not present in kanji db

[Ideas]
- tease apart stroke data from svg to produce stroke order diagrams
- svg animations possible way of animating stroke order:
    https://davidwalsh.name/svg-animation
    http://codepen.io/ghepting/pen/xnezB
- train neural net on rasterized svgs and/or bitmaps generated from fonts
- look up character by drawing it out on canvas
- line smoothing for prettier strokes
- lookup by radical
- worksheet generator

[Todos]
- Parse SVG into structure containing ordered stroke paths
- Template to render an svg given some dimensions and a list of paths
- Character view mode
- Test mode

[learning tool]
-- not good for learning the first time
-- be stricter on shape/direction and less strict on stroke order (or make it more configurable)
-- flash card
